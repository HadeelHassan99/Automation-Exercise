# Automation-Exercise
Approach
Page Object Model (POM):

HomePage: Contains methods for navigating through the site, such as selecting products and adding them to the cart.
LoginPage: Contains methods for login with valid credentials
CartPage: Methods for proceeding to checkout.
CheckoutPage: Methods for entering shipping/billing information.
PaymentPage: Methods for completing the order.
Data-Driven Approach:

Use an external data source (e.g., an Excel or CSV file) to store test data, including shipping/billing information and product details.
Each data set will be used for testing different scenarios (e.g., valid and invalid checkout).
Test Data File:

Create a data file (CSV or Excel) containing product details and shipping/billing information.
Sample fields for the data file:
Product name, quantity
Shipping address, billing address, credit card details
Test Automation Script:

Test Setup: Use TestNG to configure the test and initialize WebDriver and other required dependencies.
Test Execution: Implement test methods using Selenium to interact with the website based on POM.
Assertions: Verify that the checkout steps complete successfully, such as:
Correct product added to cart.
Correct shipping and billing information displayed.
Order confirmation received.
Reporting:

Use Allure or Extent Reports to generate detailed reports.
The reports will show the status of each step, including any failures.
GitHub Repository:

Host the source code, along with the test scripts, POM, data files, and test report.
Tools Used
Selenium: For automating browser interactions.
TestNG: For test execution, managing test cases, and reporting.
Page Object Model (POM): For better code organization and maintainability.
Allure/Extent Reports: For test reporting.
GitHub: For version control and sharing the project.
Implementation
Create Page Objects:

HomePage: Select products, add to cart.
CartPage: Proceed to checkout.
CheckoutPage: Enter shipping/billing info.
OrderConfirmationPage: Confirm the order.
Create Data-Driven Test:

Read product and user information from a CSV or Excel file using libraries like Apache POI or OpenCSV.
Test Flow:

Select a product and add it to the cart.
Proceed to checkout and fill in the data from the data file.
Complete the order and validate confirmation.
Reporting:

Generate reports with Allure or Extent Reports to show the status of test execution.
